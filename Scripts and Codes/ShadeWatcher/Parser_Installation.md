# ShadeWatcher Parser Installation
 To streamline the installation process for the parsers, i have provided 2 shell scripts for 2 ubuntu distros.

# Usage
  Give the appropriate permissions to the shell scripts before you start the installation.
  ```
  chmod +x <scriptname.sh>
  sudo ./<scriptname.sh>
  ```
